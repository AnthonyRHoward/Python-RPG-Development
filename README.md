# Text Based RPG.
 Choose Your Own Adventure Game 

# Hello from Anthony.
This was created without the use of any video tutorials, templates, or guides. 
I wanted to prove to myself that I could make this on my own and be able to
learn the in's and out's of programming.

There are ovbious mistakes that have been made in creating this, however,
I plan on learning from those and progressing my knowledge moving forward.
Although this is easy for most, this was a first attempt at creating 
something that wasn't a simple "Hello World.". 

The goal is to eventually convert this into a Discord Bot by importing
and redesigning this to work with the Discord.Py framework.
